# Gesture Controlled Robotic hand

* The project is designed to develop an  Gesture Controlled Robotic Arm. Now-a-days  robotic  arm  is used  in  various  areas such  as  military,  defense,  medical  surgeries, pick  and  place  function  in industrial automation applications.
 Based on  the gesture of human hands the  robotic arm moves and performs the task and this system  replicates the  actions of human  hands.
 The  arm  is very  flexible  and can  be  made suitable  in  places  where  the environment is not safe for humans like firework manufacturing industry,bomb  diffusing  etc. 
 There  are  various  techniques for  controlling  the  robotic  arm.

<h1>REQUIRED LIBRARAY</h1>

1.Arduino Software


**CIRCUIT DIAGRAM**

* The circuit Diagram is given below .The All 5 Servo Motor Signal Pin will be Connected to the arduino Pwm Pin Number 9,so We can use a seprate bread board for better connection .
  The 5V pin will be connected to Arduino 5v pin and Ground pin will be connected to Arduino Ground pin.Arduino must be connected to Pc through arduino Cable.

 **FUNCTIONAL PREVIEW**
 
 * At first the arduino code will be uploaded to arduino Uno board using 
 arduino IDE and the servo motor move continuously for every 5 seconds and the All finger's are Folded Simultaneously.
